  In order to check account budget module in OpenERP I created a budget with few budget positions
-
  Creating a account.budget record
-
  !record {model: account.budget, id: crossovered_budget_budget0}:
    code: B2011
    start_date: !eval "'%s-01-01' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
    end_date: !eval "'%s-12-31' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
    name: !eval "'Budget %s' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
    state: draft
-
  I created two different budget lines
-
  Modifying a account.budget record
-
  !record {model: account.budget, id: crossovered_budget_budget0}:
    account.budget_line:
      - analytic_account_id: account.analytic_consultancy
        start_date: !eval "'%s-01-01' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
        end_date: !eval "'%s-12-31' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
        general_budget_id: account_budget.account_budget_post_purchase0
        planned_amount: 10000.0
      - analytic_account_id: account.analytic_super_product_trainings
        start_date: !eval "'%s-09-01' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
        end_date: !eval "'%s-09-30' %(datetime.now().year+1)"
        general_budget_id: account_budget.account_budget_post_sales0
        planned_amount: 400000.0

  I check that Initially Budget is in "draft" state
-
  !assert {model: account.budget, id: crossovered_budget_budget0}:
    - state == 'draft'

-
  I pressed the confirm button to confirm the Budget
-
  Performing a workflow action confirm on module account.budget
-
  !workflow {model: account.budget, action: confirm, ref: crossovered_budget_budget0}
-
  I check that budget is in "Confirmed" state
-
  !assert {model: account.budget, id: crossovered_budget_budget0}:
    - state == 'confirm'

-
  I pressed the validate button to validate the Budget
-
  Performing a workflow action validate on module account.budget
-
  !workflow {model: account.budget, action: validate, ref: crossovered_budget_budget0}
-
  I check that budget is in "Validated" state
-
  !assert {model: account.budget, id: crossovered_budget_budget0}:
    - state == 'validate'

-
  I pressed the done button to set the Budget to "Done" state
-
  Performing a workflow action done on module account.budget
-
  !workflow {model: account.budget, action: done, ref: crossovered_budget_budget0}
-
  I check that budget is in "done" state
-
  !assert {model: account.budget, id: crossovered_budget_budget0}:
    - state == 'done'
